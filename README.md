# Master-thesis-steganography

## Steganography algorithms:
- steganographyAlgorythm.py - Abstract class, all stego algorithms inherit from it.
- sample.py - Demo stego algorithm, the simplest LSB implementation.
- LSB.py - Least Significant Bit. A unique message is added at the end of the message to signal the end of the hidden text.
